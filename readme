Hello This Test was created based on the test that was sended out from Rackspace


The account password was changed to
OnicaTest1234910

did configure the access key and Secret Access key for this account

The access key: is AKIAWIIJP2SVSYDSLWHK
The Secret Access key is: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

used the serverless framework for this test
and the programming framework is the NODE.JS(for Javascript)


if the serverless framework was not configured then use

serverless config credentials --provider aws --key AKIAWIIJP2SVSYDSLWHK --secret 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

navigate to the directory with serverless.yml used the following command to  deploy this api
then use:
sls deploy --stage dev
sls deploy --stage prod

functions: the following is for dev environment, its similar in production environment except that "dev" woud be become "prod" if changed to production
  createEmployee: my-employee-application-dev-createEmployee

  this function is used to create employee accept parameter such as
  {"id": "1", "firstname":"John","lastname":"Mac"}


  getEmployee: my-employee-application-dev-getEmployee
  getting single employee and all its information

  the return result should be
   {"id": "1", name:{"firstname":"John","lastname":"mac"}}

  getEmployees: my-employee-application-dev-getEmployees
  getting all employee's Id(data need to exist in dyanmodb)

  return result is similar to " 1 2 3 4 5 6 "

  there is also the proxy gateway for routing other than above
  app: my-employee-application-dev-app

  the command used for testing would be similar to

  curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST ${BASE_DOMAIN}/employees -d '{"id": "1", "firstname":"John","lastname":"Mac"}'
  curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X GET ${BASE_DOMAIN}/employee/2

  the base domain is the deployed api address similar as:
  where the BASE_DOMAIN=https://4d0zprlx54.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/employees


Note:
right now the retention policy for the default log group is 30.however there is a log group named  API-Gateway-Execution-Logs(ex. API-Gateway-Execution-Logs_4d0zprlx54/dev)
for dev and prod stage which stores all the result for the execution log, currently due toI am unable to figure out the retention policy for API-Gatway log file group.
